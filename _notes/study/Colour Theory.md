### Colour Wheel

#### Primary
Red Yellow and Blue
3
#### Secondary
By mixing combinations of red, yellow, and blue
3
Orange, green, violet
#### Intermediates
Primary + Secondary
6

#### Complementary 
colours opposite

#### Adjacent


### Hue, Value, and Intensity

All colours have - Hue, Intensity, and Value
Munsell System

#### Hue 
Hue = name of colour
Warm or cold
Warmth of a colour is a property of hue
	- We can divide the colour wheel into two halves - 
	  with orange in the center of one one side  and blue at the center of the other   Colours near orange are warm, colours near blue are cool
	  Why? Psychological association
	  - Colours halfway between are fairly neutral
	  - To add warmth, we usually add yellow
	  - To add coldness, we usually add blue
	  - there can be a "cool green" and a "warm green"
	  - useful for colour schemes for harmony

#### Value 
Most important dimension
Lightness or darkness 
**Shade** - add black
**Tint** - add white

#### Intensity
aka saturation aka purity aka strength
To lower intensity, add grey

### Some rules 

#### 1. Every colour affects the other colour 
and how we perceive it. 
Depending on the colour of other elements, the background, etc. something might appear too dark or too small

#### 2. Adding depth 
Warmer colours seem to appear closer 
Cooler colours appear farther
Farther elements - cooler and less intense

#### 3. Colour under different light conditions
direction of light, direct/indirect light, shadows, the surface underneath/reflected light, everything plays a role

#### 4. Different lights create different colors
Sunlight = warm
Artificial light = cool 

setting, effect 

shadows - usually cool

#### 5. Emotional Effect of Colour

#### 6. Colours create different moods
Bright, warm colours - happy and light
low dark colours - gloomy

value and intensity = low? gloomy mood, serious atmosphere

#### 7. Colour proportion !!!
Don't use too many colours, too intensely 
Stick to fewer hues 
too many intense colours = compete for attention, appear in disarray, sore to look at

#### 8. Set Palette

### Colour Schemes
-   **Monochromatic** – Take one hue and create other elements from different shades and tints of it.
   
-   **Analogous** – Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange and yellow to show sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme (e.g., flames).    

-   **Complementary** – Use “opposite color” pairs—e.g., blue/yellow—to maximize contrast.

-   **Split-Complementary** (or **Compound Harmony**) – Add colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften contrast.

-   **Triadic** – Take **three** colors which are **equally distant on the color wheel** (i.e., 120° apart: e.g., red/blue/yellow). These colors may not be vibrant, but the _scheme_ can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It’s easier to make visually appealing designs with this than with a complementary scheme.
   
-   **Tetradic** – Take **four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs** (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet) and choose one dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the _balance_ between warm and cool colors.
    
-   **Square** – A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90° apart). Unlike tetradic, square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.

### RGB vs CMYK

RGB - Additive colour scheme. Used for screens. EMITS light, so more you add colours, gets brighter. Add all colours, you get white

CMYK - **subtractive color** palette. Print. Absorbs light. More colour you add, the darker it gets. Add all colours, you get black
