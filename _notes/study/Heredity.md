## DNA

Deoxyribonucleic Acid

genetic code
synthesis of protein - blueprint
double helix

made up of four bases ATGC 
Adenine Cytosine Guanine Thymine 


Gene - A section of DNA that encodes for a certain trait; unit of heredity

Chromosome - made up of genes

[[Mitosis]]
[[Meiosis]] 

[[karyotype]] - picture of the full set of chromosomes in a person’s cells
[[genotype]] - sum of all genes 
[[phenotype]] - EXPRESSED; not all genes are expressed. Some need environmental triggers etc

Allele - Alternate gene

22 autosomes 
23rd - sex chromosome

Testing for genetic disorders - 
-   **Carrier testing:** This blood test shows whether you or your partner carry a mutation linked to genetic disorders. This is recommended for everyone considering pregnancy, even if there is no family history.
-   **Prenatal screening:** This testing usually involves blood testing from a pregnant person that tells them how likely it is that a fetus could have a common chromosome condition.
-   **Prenatal diagnostic testing:** You can find out whether the developing fetus faces a higher risk for certain genetic disorders. Prenatal testing uses a sample of fluid from your uterus - **amniocentesis**
-   **Newborn screening:** This test uses a sample of your newborn baby’s blood and is performed on all babies born in Ohio. Detecting genetic disorders early in life can help your child receive timely care if needed
- **villus sampling**
