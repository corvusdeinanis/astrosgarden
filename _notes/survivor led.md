title: Survivor-Led, Why?
tag: about
---

I'm a huge proponent of science and modern medicine
but I believe in survivor-led  over more clinical approaches.


There's so much bias, malpractice, stigma, and discrimination out there. Clinicians aren't immune to this.  
I've met dozens and dozens  of people working in the mental health sector who  perpetuate the very ideals
that re-traumatize us. This, however, is not an endorsement to skip professional help 
and I don't mean to take anything away from science and medicine. Clinicians help. 
They've helped me and helped countless others. But remember that they're fallible too, and remember,
most of all, that medical help is not the end-all that is purported to be. 


## Why do you not trust clinicians?


I do. I do trust them, but everyone needs to know one thing - clincians aren't infallible. <br>
<i> Science can be infallible. Scientists are not.  </i> <br> 

Second opinions are your friend, do use them whenever you can. Ask questions, find a clinician <br>
who answers your questions patiently. Ask about your diagnosis. Google the medicines. <br> 
There are off-label uses, Google isn't a replacement to professional help, but that's why honest conversation matters. <br>

With that being said, especially in the area of mental health, a lot of professionals are ill-informed, ignorant, biased <br>
and sometimes downright malicious. I say this as a student of Psychology, as a student who has been through lecture <br>
where the professors perpetuate stigma. As a person whose friends have been through the same. <br> [Here](https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2021/05000/professional_stigma_of_mental_health_issues_.27.aspx) [are](http://bibliobase.sermais.pt:8008/BiblioNET/Upload/PDF13/009809%20Lancet%20Psychiatry%202014,%206,%20%20467-482.pdf) [some](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/stigma-and-discrimination) [links](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00326/full)

This is not to chastise professionals, but this is a reminder that if you have been burnt out by professionals, <br>
you're not alone and you have not exhausted all your options. ♥
