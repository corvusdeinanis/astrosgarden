[[Sub Editor]]

## Bites vs Interview

> Bites - quick question or two
> Interview - full fledged

Use quotes, don't manipulate

<700 words = article; otherwise feature

Pictures -> only relevant ones, not compulsory; Press Council of India has laws. Crime related will have lesser / no photos

 - Value of news story
 - Authenticity 
 - Don't mislead, misquote or manipulate
 - Byline is important (name of the reporter) | subeditor edits the article but doesn't get byline credits
- **5Ws and H; bites, conclusion**
- subeditors translate, fix grammatical errors, proofread, layout, ads, images, and conclusiom

subeditors are the backbone of the newspaper
