The Birth Process occurs in **three stages**

## First Stage
Uterine contractions cause the woman's cervix to stretch and open
DILATE the cervix to an opening of ~10cm so baby can move from uterus to birth canal

## Second Stage
Baby's head starts to move through the cervix and the birth canal. Stops when the baby emerges

## Third Stage  | After birth
