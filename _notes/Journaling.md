## Journaling

- Gratitude
- Reflect, Progress, Tweak
- Goal Setting
- Mindfulness
- GROUNDING
- Morning Ritual


As a morning ritual, it sets the pace for the day. Helps unwind. Helps keep a track of everything. Second brain. It’s your new best friend. Something is worrying you? Dump that into the journal. Need to keep track of a goal? No worries, your journal will remember! 

**Your journal is your accountability partner, and your best friend. It’s the medium through which you can converse with the three yous.**  SECOND BRAIN. Short lived thoughts -> written down things you can refer

A few journaling ideas from the community - 

1. "Journal whatever you're feeling, especially when you're hit by overwhelming feelings. Later, when the waves have receded, look at your writing again and try to reframe it in a different perspective."  - S. I recommend using [[Distortions|cognitive distortions]] along with this!

2.  Writing down your thoughts but being [[Mindfulness|mindful]] that it is your narrative, that it is what your brain thinks to be true. And then asking questions that will help you deconstruct the narrative and understand yourself and the world better. 

WHAT YOU CAN INCLUDE

- Quotes that resonate 
- Names of people you recently met
- Words you heard or read that you want to look up the definition later
- Words you want to remember to use in conversation
- Ideas about what to do later, or what you have to do later
- Things you saw that you thought were funny
- Places you want to visit soon
- Short story ideas
- Mindfulness observations (write down what you see, feel, hear, etc. to de-stress)
- Books/Articles you want to read later
- Important dates
- Credit card reminders
- Things you want to remember to bring tomorrow
- Names of things you didn't know before
