[[Columnist]] 
not on a daily basis

**not** inverted pyramid 
not purely factual so [[soft news]]
**opinion-based**
human-interest stories(?)
style of columnist is important; style > substance

topic - no specific or set topic, can be about anything that interests people; 
style is dependent on columnist, more flexible
can be in tabloids AND broadsheets

1. Creates awareness, 
2. generate interest among readers
3. give the paper a face / identity 
   an image; strengthens it 
4. readers might buy certain newspapers just to read the columns

editors encourage feedback and interaction, generate views because opinion based

> [!NOTE]- Image of the paper
> **editorial** page, **front** page -> can tell you the alignments of the newspaper and their idealogies; 
> the kinds of adverts, the kind of headlines,
