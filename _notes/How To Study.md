#### Fast Facts
1.  Some study methods work in many different situations and across topics, boosting test performance and long-term retention. Learning how to learn can have lifelong benefits.
2.  Self-testing and spreading out study sessions — so-called distributed practice — are excellent ways to improve learning. They are efficient, easy to use and effective.
3.  Underlining and rereading, two methods that many students use, are ineffective and can be time-consuming.
4.  Other learning techniques need further testing and evaluation. In the meantime, students and teachers can put proved study methods to use in classrooms and at home.

#### Learning methods ranked by efficacy
Learning methods and their efficacies were also discussed. The winners according to the study are :
