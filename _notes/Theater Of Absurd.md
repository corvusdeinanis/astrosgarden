## Anti-Language
- No fixed pattern 
- Characters talk disorderly 
  What the character has said is not the words that his partner has asked or wanted to get. Sometimes a character asks his partner something, but the partner says another thing that is irrelevant to what they are talking about. 
  
	- ***Non sequitur***
- what they have said cannot be understood by the audience. 

## **Anti-drama**
it is more difficult for us to understand the world from a normal point of view. The audience and the readers fail to identify with the characters in the play so people find it  humorous and funny. 

## **Anti-Plot**
The plot is **scattered** and **fractured**. 
It is surprising or obscure and most of the time it has no end or result. 
For example - in *waiting for Godot*, the audience cannot understand the ending of the play; they don't know what they are waiting for and what they are talking about. We just know they are having an endless conversation and endlessly waiting.
